Our password vault offers multiple authentication methods, including biometric fingerprint recognition and master password access. The vault supports importing from 45 different password manager formats across four standard export types. Let me demonstrate by importing a LastPass file - as you can see, six entries imported successfully. The vault automatically locks when you navigate away for security, protecting your data at all times.
