The first step is to aggregate existing email accounts. We support multiple email providers, allowing users to centralize all their accounts into one secure location. I'll demonstrate by connecting my Gmail account. While this requires an app password - a process most providers make unnecessarily complex - we streamline this with direct links to the exact settings pages for each provider. We connect via the IMAP protocol, though we also support POP3, giving users flexibility in how they access and control their email data.
