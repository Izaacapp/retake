Everything automatically syncs between our Electron desktop application and our Flutter mobile implementation. On mobile, we've implemented Face ID for seamless biometric authentication while maintaining full feature parity across all platforms. The breach reporting feature uses the Have I Been Pwned API to provide comprehensive details about specific security incidents, giving users complete visibility into their exposure across the web. As you can see, all passwords imported on desktop are now available on mobile, demonstrating seamless cross-platform synchronization.
