    "script": "Good morning. We are Deeply Profound, a research security group tackling one of the most critical problems in cybersecurity today: the credential breach crisis. When your credentials are compromised in a single data breach, it can trigger a cascade of security risks across dozens of platforms where you've reused passwords.",

    "script": "The current remediation process is fundamentally broken. Manual password rotation requires visiting each website individually - a time-consuming and error-prone process. This creates verification code chaos, with codes sent to email inboxes that lack privacy and security. The reality is most people don't rotate passwords after breaches because the process is simply too difficult and time-consuming.",

    "script": "Our solution is a two-part platform designed to automate security remediation. The first component is Aether Mail, an aggregated and private email service. The second is a secure password vault that works in tandem with Aether Mail to completely automate the password rotation process. Let me demonstrate how this works in practice.",

    "script": "The first step is to aggregate existing email accounts. We support multiple email providers, allowing users to centralize all their accounts into one secure location. I'll demonstrate by connecting my Gmail account. While this requires an app password - a process most providers make unnecessarily complex - we streamline this with direct links to the exact settings pages for each provider. We connect via the IMAP protocol, though we also support POP3, giving users flexibility in how they access and control their email data.",

    "script": "Testing automation on mainstream platforms would result in immediate account suspension. That's why we developed a dedicated testing environment that replicates real-world password reset flows. Our platform includes a sophisticated password generator that creates strong, secure passwords while giving users full control over format and length. Users can choose between random passwords that mix letters, numbers, and special characters for maximum security, or memorable passphrases that are easier to remember. While our automated system handles password rotation, users can always manually override and select their own passwords if preferred.",

The breach reporting feature uses the Have I Been Pwned API to provide comprehensive details about specific security incidents, giving users complete visibility into their exposure across the web. As you can see, all passwords imported on desktop are now available on mobile, demonstrating seamless cross-platform synchronization.",
