================================================================================

## Segment 1: DEMO: Password Vault
Time: 00:07:00 - 00:08:00 (60s)

Our password vault offers multiple authentication methods, including biometric fingerprint recognition and master password access. The vault supports importing from 45 different password manager formats across four standard export types. Let me demonstrate by importing a LastPass file - as you can see, six entries imported successfully. The vault automatically locks when you navigate away for security, protecting your data at all times.

## Segment 2: DEMO: Mobile Sync
Time: 00:08:00 - 00:09:00 (60s)

Everything automatically syncs between our Electron desktop application and our Flutter mobile implementation. On mobile, we've implemented Face ID for seamless biometric authentication while maintaining full feature parity across all platforms. The breach reporting feature uses the Have I Been Pwned API to provide comprehensive details about specific security incidents, giving users complete visibility into their exposure across the web. As you can see, all passwords imported on desktop are now available on mobile, demonstrating seamless cross-platform synchronization.
