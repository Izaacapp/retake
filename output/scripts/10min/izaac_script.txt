## Segment 1: INTRODUCTION
Time: 00:00:00 - 00:00:45 (45s)

Good morning. We are Deeply Profound, a research security group tackling one of the most critical problems in cybersecurity today: the credential breach crisis. When your credentials are compromised in a single data breach, it can trigger a cascade of security risks across dozens of platforms where you've reused passwords.

## Segment 2: THE PROBLEM
Time: 00:00:45 - 00:01:30 (45s)

The current remediation process is fundamentally broken. Manual password rotation requires visiting each website individually - a time-consuming and error-prone process. This creates verification code chaos, with codes sent to email inboxes that lack privacy and security. The reality is most people don't rotate passwords after breaches because the process is simply too difficult and time-consuming.

[Note: Problem statement - pain points clearly defined]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Segment 3: OUR SOLUTION
Time: 00:01:30 - 00:02:00 (30s)

Our solution is a two-part platform designed to automate security remediation. The first component is Aether Mail, an aggregated and private email service. The second is a secure password vault that works in tandem with Aether Mail to completely automate the password rotation process. Let me demonstrate how this works in practice.

## Segment 4: DEMO: Account Creation & Dashboard
Time: 00:02:00 - 00:02:30 (30s)

This is the first screen users see when entering our platform. The account creation process generates secure credentials that users save locally, along with a key file for platform access. After logging in, users arrive at the main dashboard where they can access all of our platform's key features.

## Segment 5: DEMO: Email Aggregation
Time: 00:02:30 - 00:03:30 (60s)

The first step is to aggregate existing email accounts. We support multiple email providers, allowing users to centralize all their accounts into one secure location. I'll demonstrate by connecting my Gmail account. While this requires an app password - a process most providers make unnecessarily complex - we streamline this with direct links to the exact settings pages for each provider. We connect via the IMAP protocol, though we also support POP3, giving users flexibility in how they access and control their email data.

[Note: Email aggregation demo - show IMAP connection]

## Segment 6: DEMO: Password Rotation Automation
Time: 00:03:30 - 00:04:30 (60s)

With the account successfully connected and syncing, I'll now navigate to the password rotation module. The system actively monitors connected inboxes, intelligently parsing emails to automatically detect and extract verification codes. This is the key innovation that enables full automation of the password reset process. As you can see here, a verification code has arrived from our test website, demonstrating the seamless integration.

## Segment 7: DEMO: Unified Inbox
Time: 00:05:30 - 00:06:15 (45s)

This is our unified inbox interface, providing a consolidated view of all emails from connected accounts. The system parses through these emails to extract verification codes automatically. This automation completely eliminates the need for users to manually visit dozens of websites after a breach, transforming a process that typically takes hours into one that happens seamlessly in the background.

[Note: Show unified inbox with parsed verification codes]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Segment 8: CONCLUSION
Time: 00:09:00 - 00:10:00 (60s)

That concludes our demonstration of the Deeply Profound platform. We've shown how we solve the credential breach crisis through automated password rotation, centralized email management, and cross-platform synchronization - all while maintaining the highest standards of security and privacy. Our platform transforms what was once a time-consuming manual process into a seamless automated experience. Thank you for your time and attention.
