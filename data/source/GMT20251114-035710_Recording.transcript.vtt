00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:16.710
Zoom user: Hello, everyone. We're gonna start off with who we are. We are Deeply Profound. Deeply Profound is a research security group found with a singular mission. It's to solve a critical pervasive problem in cybersecurity today.

2
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:25.980
Zoom user: We begin by asking ourselves, how do we remedy security breaches across multiple services and credentials that are compromised?

3
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.120
Zoom user: The problem… so the main problem we're solving is the credential breach crisis.

4
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:44.570
Zoom user: When your credentials are compromised in a data breach, you face a cascade of problems. Multiple services, multiple passwords, one breach exposes you across dozens of platforms.

5
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.909
Zoom user: Manual password rotation is obviously a headache. You must visit each site individually to reset passwords.

6
00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:05.899
Zoom user: Verification code chaos. Each service sends codes via email requiring constant inbox checking. No privacy. Email providers scan your messages, expose your sensitive verification codes.

7
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.450
Zoom user: Cross-platform exposure, breach credentials on web platform, Compromise others.

8
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.520
Zoom user: The reality is, most people don't rotate passwords after breaches because it's too difficult and it's too time-consuming.

9
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.849
Zoom user: So, one of the solutions we came up with was, an aggregated email service, and that is EtherMail.

10
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.630
Zoom user: And, the other component of the platform is, the password, vault.

11
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.450
Zoom user: And…

12
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.869
Zoom user: So we'll be transitioning over to the vault and showing the first key features of what we have so far.

13
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.720
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: You're muted.

14
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.290
Kenith Philip: Sure, good. Okay.

15
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.080
Devon Villalona: Right now, I shall be demonstrating the desktop features with Electron.

16
00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.670
Devon Villalona: I will now demonstrate.

17
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.689
Devon Villalona: The login with it?

18
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.429
Devon Villalona: With our… within the application…

19
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.959
Devon Villalona: Alright, we shall see… we shall now see the breach report. We are using an API called I've Been Pwned to…

20
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.870
Devon Villalona: search up breach reports. Right now, we'll just do my email for now.

21
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.460
Devon Villalona: Go ahead and hurry that off.

22
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.250
Devon Villalona: As you can see,

23
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:54.380
Devon Villalona: The breach report shows many different compromises in the millions of accounts that have been compromises, and even mine, with article links and everything, to show the user that there are many, breaches within the email.

24
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.380
Devon Villalona: And then I can return a dashboard right here.

25
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.460
Devon Villalona: And we'll talk about the Ether Mail.

26
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:11.959
Zoom user: So, this is the first thing the user would see when they, enter our platform, so…

27
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:21.229
Zoom user: I'm gonna first show you how we create an account. User comes, obviously agrees to our terms, they'll generate an account.

28
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.859
Zoom user: So, these credentials that are generated, the user would essentially save these down, and download the key to, enter the platform.

29
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.300
Zoom user: So, now go to login.

30
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.050
Zoom user: So, those same credentials that you just saw there.

31
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:19.579
Zoom user: So… After user enters, this would be essentially, The dashboard? So…

32
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.930
Zoom user: We have the big main key features of The mail service, of course.

33
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.779
Zoom user: would be the external accounts. This is the first thing a user would have to do when they enter a platform, is to aggregate their email services.

34
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:41.730
Zoom user: So, we offer support across multiple different, email providers, so users could aggregate all of them to one location.

35
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.440
Zoom user: So I'll enter my Gmail right now.

36
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.360
Zoom user: So, user… for most, services, they have to add.

37
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:44.080
Zoom user: They unfortunately have to get an app password, and most, email providers, they go out their way to make this very obscure. Lucky for you guys, we've added the links that could take the user straight there, so they could generate their app password. Once you do that, user enters their credentials, this is me, for example.

38
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:55.709
Zoom user: I'm doing this with the IMAP protocol. We also offer support for the Pope Protocol, which essentially means you could pull, all your logs out, said server, and…

39
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:02.810
Zoom user: take control of your data, but fast forward, we'll be using the IMAP protocol. I'll add the count right here.

40
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.650
Zoom user: So, this just verifies,

41
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:28.109
Zoom user: That it went through. Did… even use the IMAP protocol, I had to use DevCot. DevCot is an email, requirement to send mails.

42
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:34.269
Zoom user: And then I also had to use postfix, but this essentially verifies that it went through, so now I'm synced.

43
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:42.860
Zoom user: So then I would go over to pass rotation. So now, my inbox is synced, of course. So now I'm fetching from my actual email.

44
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.219
Zoom user: That I just connected.

45
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:06.349
Zoom user: And then boom. So the verification code came in, so this essentially would be for a targeted website.

46
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.049
Zoom user: And then, yeah, so now I'll be showing you the demo website.

47
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.540
Zoom user: Or Ken will be showing you the demo website.

48
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.530
Kenith Philip: Okay. So, having a…

49
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:47.170
Kenith Philip: Applications are complex, also comes with a lot of challenges. One of them is testing. Testing it on a mainstream website or application is obviously going to get us banned real quick. So, which is why we came up with a dummy website, a testing website here, so I will be showing you

50
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:52.529
Kenith Philip: how we have that set up. So, I have an account set up right here.

51
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.099
Kenith Philip: which I'll be logging into.

52
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:15.949
Kenith Philip: So as you can see, once I log in, it's a real simple website, which basically shows your username and your email, and some very basic information. Another feature of EtherMail that I'd like to show you

53
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:39.270
Kenith Philip: is the password generator, which basically lets users generate passwords, securely, and also gives them a choice on how they want to do it. They can either choose a random password, which mixes up letters, characters, and all that, or they could have a memorable one, which is easier to memorize. We also have a slider where you can choose the size of the password you want to set.

54
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:56.480
Kenith Philip: And yeah, so this could be used… the password rotation, which we'll be talking next, automatically does it, but we also give the user the choice to manually override it and choose a password of their own, if they wish to do so. I'll be handing it over back to Isaac.

55
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:07.169
Zoom user: So As you just went over the password generator, I'll be showing you how the email inbox looks like.

56
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:53.139
Zoom user: Alright, we'll be doing the severity scoring algorithm as this loads. Oh, actually, that's crazy. So, this is essentially what the user would see in the inbox. This is one, email, obviously, that I attached. You could attach multiple emails, and essentially, it'd be pulling in all your email from here.

57
00:10:53.380 --> 00:11:00.059
Zoom user: We parse through this to get the verification codes, and the verification codes, essentially, how we're able to…

58
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:10.570
Zoom user: like, automate the whole process of the password rotation so the user doesn't have to go to each website one by one manually to, essentially

59
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:16.300
Zoom user: Spent hours at end to do multiple breaches across multiple services.

60
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.939
Zoom user: And yeah, this is the meal platform.

61
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:59.300
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Hello, I'm Jewel. I work on, security and API.

62
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.900
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Architecture.

63
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:10.470
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: And I just want to go over some… In terms of… use for our… Platform.

64
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.890
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: when you… Sign up to use our service.

65
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:23.479
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: We ask that you, sign the terms of use, and with that, For you to understand that.

66
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:31.400
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: You are consenting to use our application, and we do require that you provide us with… You're…

67
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.780
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Credentials from your emails in order to access them.

68
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:43.919
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Additionally, we have a very privacy-oriented setup, so we do not keep track of

69
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.839
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Any of your information, and everything is end-to-end encrypted.

70
00:12:54.130 --> 00:13:02.930
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: So you want to make sure… so we want to make sure that you are… getting security, from…

71
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.670
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Top to bottom.

72
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.409
Devon Villalona: That would be fair internal.

73
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.550
Devon Villalona: I guess…

74
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.169
Devon Villalona: Oh, he's gonna make the… he has to make a cut anyways. The Jules… Jules, are you done?

75
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:35.300
Devon Villalona: There is…

76
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.430
Zoom user: Yeah, he's done, just keep on, just keep on.

77
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:46.450
Devon Villalona: Back to the Electron app on desktop, I shall be showing you guys the password vault and how you access it.

78
00:13:46.770 --> 00:14:01.270
Devon Villalona: There's two ways to do it. On the screen, you can see there's a biometric fingerprint reader for Apple, or you can use your master user password that is offered when you register for our application. So let's go ahead and get inside the vault.

79
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:23.239
Devon Villalona: Here, you can see, where you can import all the different types of, emails and password into the vault in different formats. As you can see, here's the import, we have a manual one, there's one for last, past CSV, all in four different formats, but supported by 45 different, password,

80
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.699
Devon Villalona: Formats, in companies.

81
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.549
Devon Villalona: So we're gonna go ahead and, show you an example here.

82
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.530
Devon Villalona: LastPass.

83
00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.599
Devon Villalona: There we go, 6 imports.

84
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:50.159
Devon Villalona: So, obviously, it imported in the vault, and as I import it into the vault, it's going to sync with mobile. Everything in the entire electron application is in sync with mobile, with,

85
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:59.440
Devon Villalona: the same features. So, obviously, if user were to go to the dashboard right now and go back in, obviously it locks itself.

86
00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.269
Devon Villalona: And it's there.

87
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.980
Devon Villalona: And obviously, if you go here to lock it, it's still there. So let's go ahead and talk about…

88
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:22.089
Devon Villalona: the CV Security Alerts. So, CV Security Alerts is an API we're using with, conjunction with a breach report. This is for, like, if you want to, search up your breach reports, from, our, Have Been Pwned database.

89
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:28.349
Devon Villalona: to get more of a detailed report. Let's say if, like, you were reported on a breach with Walmart.

90
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:30.180
Devon Villalona: What the hell?

91
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.169
Devon Villalona: That's weird, it just worked before.

92
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:46.320
Devon Villalona: There it is. Alright, so as you can see, Walmart, it shows you the, more information on the report and what happened, the severity of it.

93
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:55.240
Devon Villalona: And… Now we shall be showing you our mobile, sync and implementations and features.

94
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.470
Devon Villalona: could.

95
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:09.919
Devon Villalona: And then that's it, but he does have to do editing. I gotta… now I gotta do the mobile thing. Yeah. Well, you want me to do it on the… the… just… you wanna do it? Or do… am I gonna do a voiceover?

96
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:19.029
Devon Villalona: You're gonna, you're gonna do it, like, you're gonna put it in after, right? Yeah. Okay, cool. The screen recording probably would do it, right? You haven't joined David.

97
00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:25.520
Devon Villalona: No, no, he wants me to screen… you want to be screen recorded, right? Right. Or you want me to do the Zoom recording?

98
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:29.770
Devon Villalona: I could do one either.

99
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.419
Devon Villalona: On… on the Zoom? Yeah, alright.

100
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.030
Devon Villalona: Alright, I'm gonna join back.

101
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.600
Devon Villalona: It's probably easier for the reporting route, I do.

102
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.039
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: By the way, we're at, like, 15 minutes.

103
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:48.950
Devon Villalona: Yeah, it's fine. Got it. So, major caught taking out. Yeah, he's gonna have to do that.

104
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.200
Zoom user: There's, like, 5 minutes he's cutting. It doesn't matter.

105
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.230
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Cut my whole session out.

106
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.979
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Honestly, I don't think that's even needed.

107
00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.349
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: You could take my whole section out, I don't… it's whatever.

108
00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:11.459
Zoom user: Yeah, I mean, you could do that, but… That's low-key a red flag.

109
00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.400
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: I mean, it's not like…

110
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.839
Zoom user: Yes.

111
00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:22.339
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: So as long as we explain the project.

112
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:27.759
Devon Villalona: There's a limit, though, it can't be past, like, it's gotta be, like, the most, like, 11 minutes.

113
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.110
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: No, like, yeah, 11 minutes max.

114
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:39.989
Devon Villalona: No, everything… there's no loading screens in our video, right? Oh, yeah, we were running on a loading screen, too, so if you cut that out, like…

115
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.380
Zoom user: It's literally cutting, like, 5 minutes out.

116
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.550
Devon Villalona: Yeah.

117
00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:54.480
Devon Villalona: Alright, I'm gonna join a mobile just to give him more ammo. If he needs to cut more shit, he at least he has the mobile, okay guys? Alright, are we still recording on the Zoom? Yeah. Alright, cool. I'm gonna join a mobile.

118
00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:01.929
Devon Villalona: Let me, get the link. Where's the link? Right here? In this form.

119
00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:14.420
Devon Villalona: You can't use the same account you're logged into? Yeah, yeah, no, it's the… I look crazy.

120
00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:19.020
Devon Villalona: I'm like, fucking God, dude, damn. That shit's a lot as hell.

121
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.220
Devon Villalona: Oh, we should not click on that.

122
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:26.560
Devon Villalona: Now's the timer going out. It's, like, way too much. Alright.

123
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:38.610
Devon Villalona: Alright. Can everyone hear me in the call? I muted and deafened it.

124
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.839
Devon Villalona: I don't know.

125
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:47.609
Devon Villalona: And you can put it up, I deafened everything. Alright, cool. Alright.

126
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.040
Devon Villalona: Go ahead and unmute it here.

127
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:55.350
Devon Villalona: Alright, still recording. Awesome. I'm gonna go ahead and share the mobile now.

128
00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.410
Devon Villalona: Where the fuck is the shirt? There it is?

129
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.430
Devon Villalona: Screen.

130
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.709
Devon Villalona: Almost so I can go, bro.

131
00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.740
Devon Villalona: Share at the bottom.

132
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:15.039
Devon Villalona: Is it showing?

133
00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.959
Devon Villalona: A lot of snow.

134
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.750
Devon Villalona: the only person… last person I can see who…

135
00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:26.770
Devon Villalona: Oh.

136
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.600
Devon Villalona: That doesn't even give me an optional shit, it's stupid broke-ass shit.

137
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.310
Devon Villalona: Where's the Zoom? It's right here.

138
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:46.549
Devon Villalona: Oh, share right here. Yeah, no. Up here. Yeah, I know, bro, look at the options, check it out. Zoom, sorry, broccoli, and…

139
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:51.750
Devon Villalona: Including everything, receiving, enabled, to do not…

140
00:19:54.230 --> 00:20:00.299
Devon Villalona: Okay. Does it… do you see it now? Yeah. Do you see the password? Yes. Okay, cool. Alright.

141
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.280
Devon Villalona: Here's our, passwords, cut.

142
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:14.729
Devon Villalona: Here's our, our mobile implementation using Flutter. We're gonna go ahead and log in, and you'll see that we have a Face ID for biometric unlock, and see all their features.

143
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.959
Devon Villalona: So we go in there, right? We're gonna check breach report.

144
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.689
Devon Villalona: shared email, right? Yeah.

145
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.829
Devon Villalona: We'll use Jared's email.

146
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.080
Devon Villalona: We're gonna show Jared's email here right here.

147
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:55.409
Devon Villalona: As you can see, Jared is severely exposed to our, to everything, actually.

148
00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:10.020
Devon Villalona: And, we'll go ahead and check the password vault. As always, the password vault is, using our, Face ID instead of fingerprint, and as you can see, it's in sync with the passwords we just, imported.

149
00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.479
Devon Villalona: And of course, CVE works here, too.

150
00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.820
Devon Villalona: There you go.

151
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.710
Devon Villalona: And this will be the mobile implementation for,

152
00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:28.220
Devon Villalona: That is in sync with our desktop app, Electron.

153
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.856
Devon Villalona: Go ahead.

154
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.749
Devon Villalona: Can I throw in units?

155
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.089
Devon Villalona: And then the outro, if you want one.

156
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.550
Devon Villalona: I mean…

157
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:53.860
Devon Villalona: What do you think? You think he's freaking down to 11? Unless you wanna… you wanna do your take on it now? So you just have ammo or some shit, because you gotta talk? No, we're definitely over, we just need someone to do the ending, like… Oh, Jared, perfect, Jared, Jared does ending.

158
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.220
Devon Villalona: Real quick. He's the last one.

159
00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:02.150
Jared Zayas: How should I end it? Oh, wait, you might have to turn it on.

160
00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.949
Devon Villalona: Go ahead and exit, I'm sorry.

161
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.760
Jared Zayas: You should probably leave from your phone, too.

162
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.629
Devon Villalona: Yeah, I am.

163
00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:21.210
Jared Zayas: So… God, I don't even know how to end this.

164
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:26.650
Jared Zayas: So that concludes… Fucking…

165
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.280
Zoom user: Jesus Christ.

166
00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.040
Zoom user: Well, hold up.

167
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.110
Jared Zayas: It's like I'm performing in front of a live audience right now.

168
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:34.419
Zoom user: Yeah, you're perform… you're performing good.

169
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.759
Jared Zayas: Isaac, you're laughing at me, bro.

170
00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.360
Zoom user: Bro, you do MMA, bro, I'm good.

171
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:51.250
Jared Zayas: Alright, so that concludes our project, and our demo. Thank you for your attention. That sounds fucking dumb.

172
00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.280
Zoom user: No, it doesn't, no dozen.

173
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.850
Jared Zayas: That's gonna be short and sweet, but…

174
00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:56.110
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: And it's binding me.

175
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.940
Jared Zayas: Thanks for Jason, this is Madela.

176
00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.530
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Sounds good. Yeah, you're still confident with it.

177
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:06.660
Jared Zayas: our presentation and our demo of our project. Thank you for your attention.

178
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.020
Jared Zayas: That's everything.

179
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:09.370
Zoom user: Alright.

180
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.600
Jared Zayas: Say what?

181
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:11.710
Jared Zayas: That's it.

182
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.399
Jared Zayas: Oh, okay, yeah, okay, that's it.

183
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.490
Zoom user: And that concludes our presentation.

184
00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:21.250
Jared Zayas: profit, and…
