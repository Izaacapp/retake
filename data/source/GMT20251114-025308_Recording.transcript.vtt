00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:17.209
Zoom user: We're Go Trigger, also known as DP Profound. We're a research security group. I'm Isaac Planvec. I'm the lead architecture, and I'm also the project manager.

2
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.969
Devon Villalona: I'm Devin Ridolono. I'm the Cloud Infrastructure and API Developer.

3
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.829
Kenith Philip: Just pick one of those. I'm Ken, I'm the CICD.

4
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.430
Kenith Philip: Pipeline Architect.

5
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.920
Jared Zayas: I'm Jared Zeiss. I worked on the mobile…

6
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:47.480
Jared Zayas: Fuck the fuck, I really fucking need to… A mobile development?

7
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.690
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Hi, I'm Jewel, and I worked on security and API architecture.

8
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.129
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: The Go Trigger, just to introduce the project, is a dual platform collaboration system.

9
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.659
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Combining enterprise… Password management with automated security features.

10
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:30.079
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Built with Go, Flutter, Electron, and featuring Apple keychain-inspired architecture for Unparalleled security.

11
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.930
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: So, we have a production-ready platform.

12
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.420
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Deployed in our enterprise infrastructure with CICD automation, supporting desktop.

13
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:55.749
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Using Electron and Angular, mobile, Flutter, iOS, and a comprehensive REST API built in with Go 1.24.

14
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.460
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: So, this senior capstone project demonstrates a full-stack development

15
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.230
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: DevOps Automation and Enterprise Security Project.

16
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.609
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Enterprise, Enterprise Security Architecture Project.

17
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.270
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: And that'll be it.

18
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:27.760
Zoom user: Yeah, so, we're gonna go over some of the features of, the Code Trigger project, so…

19
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.609
Zoom user: I think the first features we definitely need to go over is probably the fault.

20
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.429
Zoom user: But before I do that, okay.

21
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.510
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: So…

22
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.130
Devon Villalona: Thanks.

23
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.879
Zoom user: Let me see Aaron's screen. Aaron's screen? Okay.

24
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.430
Zoom user: Good.

25
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.229
Devon Villalona: I'm gonna share, the desktop app.

26
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.520
Zoom user: Unless you don't have recording of the web.

27
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.700
Devon Villalona: I'm here.

28
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.600
Zoom user: No, I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do the web, I'm gonna do the, this after the full, because I feel like this ties into…

29
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.239
Devon Villalona: Alright, Dad, let me share this, Don.

30
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.120
Devon Villalona: Very cool.

31
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.859
Devon Villalona: How's it look on your guys' screen?

32
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.050
Devon Villalona: I agree.

33
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.890
Devon Villalona: Here's our application, Go Trigger in action in the Electron app.

34
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.500
Devon Villalona: It's,

35
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.359
Devon Villalona: Here, I'll walk you through how to create an account and what is required for a user to use our platform.

36
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.750
Devon Villalona: So, we'll go ahead and just make one up, we'll…

37
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.410
Devon Villalona: Test 2… no, test 4, so test 4 at… Mail.com.

38
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.100
Devon Villalona: User creates an account and is automatically given a master user password to copy or download.

39
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.910
Devon Villalona: So we'll go ahead and copy it, and save the recovery phrase.

40
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.320
Devon Villalona: And our application will be now open.

41
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.290
Zoom user: Okay, so this is where we're gonna segue into the breach report first.

42
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.070
Devon Villalona: Okay.

43
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.109
Devon Villalona: So this is… so then we'll talk about the breach report first, okay.

44
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:45.250
Zoom user: Yeah, because this will go back and forth with the features. When you go to the breach report, then it could come back to me of, like, how that would, essentially get remedied through the, the password rotation, etc, and it goes back and forth, because I feel like a lot of these features are gonna start crossing.

45
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.100
Devon Villalona: Yeah.

46
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.119
Devon Villalona: What's it called?

47
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.120
Devon Villalona: Have Impwn API, right?

48
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.130
Zoom user: Yo, yup.

49
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.519
Devon Villalona: Take two. Dashboard. That's for Jared, so he knows.

50
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.409
Devon Villalona: Cut. Action.

51
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:10.320
Devon Villalona: In our application, once the user finally gets into the dashboard, user has a lot of options. We'll first demonstrate the breach report.

52
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:22.700
Devon Villalona: The breach report uses the API from Have Been Pwned, and essentially, the user is able to put in any email address one desires to check if it's been compromised.

53
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.140
Devon Villalona: So let's… let's use mine.

54
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:49.099
Devon Villalona: As you can see, the breaches found 8 breaches, and it tells you in-depth on which company has been compromised, what happened, how many users were compromised, even an article link to said, report. And as you can see, I have a lot, Collection 1, Chegg, Mathway.

55
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.319
Devon Villalona: OMG Pop, Advanced Auto Parts, and the new one right here.

56
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.230
Devon Villalona: And users is allowed to check another email.

57
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.480
Devon Villalona: Also.

58
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:08.289
Devon Villalona: to get more in-depth and more knowledge on users' security risks, we have another API called CV Security Risk that you can check.

59
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:21.280
Devon Villalona: So as that does that, it loads an API from CVE Security Risk, And essentially, You either have a…

60
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.730
Devon Villalona: Well done.

61
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.119
Devon Villalona: 1, 2, 1…

62
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.910
Zoom user: You keep going through Brian's affair.

63
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:41.309
Devon Villalona: As we hit the CV security risk button, the API analyzes the security vulnerabilities, for my breach report.

64
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.309
Devon Villalona: And at the end, if nothing shows up, that means there was… there isn't any more, but…

65
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:54.029
Devon Villalona: But, of course, it's gonna be going a little slowly. Yeah, right now, I just slowed down, and now…

66
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.069
Devon Villalona: there is no CV security risk for my… for my email right here.

67
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.000
Devon Villalona: Okay, and then… We go to the dashboard.

68
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.380
Devon Villalona: And then, do I… do I keep going? Password vault, right?

69
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:17.529
Zoom user: So, we'll go to the vault. Actually, before we do the vault, let's go to mine, because I feel like they need to start seeing some of the other component of the…

70
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.080
Devon Villalona: getting worse.

71
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:25.120
Zoom user: Yeah, yeah. So, this is EtherMail, so this is where the user would come to,

72
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:39.829
Zoom user: remedy their password, breaches. So, like Aaron just showed you, we pull the breach report, and once we get that breach report, we know, targeted websites where, user has been compromised, and where they need to remedy their passwords.

73
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:53.740
Zoom user: So, user would come here. I already have an account created, of course, but I'll show you what the user would see. Essentially, as soon as they sign up, they would generate a key. This essentially would be their login register.

74
00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:03.469
Zoom user: they'll download their key, etc, and then they'll log in with that. So I'll just go back and log in with my credentials real quick.

75
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.240
Zoom user: Password… use password… I don't know.

76
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:24.519
Zoom user: So, those credentials that are created, user would enter those things in, and load into the platform.

77
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:34.840
Zoom user: So, of course, there's a few options the user could absolutely do.

78
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:45.319
Zoom user: So the first thing they absolutely have to do is aggregate all their emails. So in order to do that, we offer support for,

79
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.370
Zoom user: All-known email providers that are very popular.

80
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.260
Zoom user: So user would…

81
00:08:52.950 --> 00:09:00.120
Zoom user: select the option they want. If they're breached through multiple emails, they could add multiple email providers into this.

82
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:06.009
Zoom user: Pretty seamlessly, and then… We'd be able to…

83
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:16.269
Zoom user: do the password resets, etc. But for the user to even do that, they have to get the app password from any of their email providers they want to aggregate their email servers within.

84
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.100
Zoom user: So once that's happened, you enter your credentials.

85
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.360
Zoom user: I'll put mine in, for example.

86
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.659
Zoom user: User at their account.

87
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:33.059
Zoom user: So, boom, so… This is the show users successful. This is pretty much,

88
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:39.160
Zoom user: pulling through the IMAP protocol. The IMAP protocol essentially syncs all your,

89
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:46.760
Zoom user: Your mail across, multiple mail servers, so this essentially gives user control of their own mail logs.

90
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.060
Zoom user: And also, you… this is the only way…

91
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:58.300
Zoom user: to aggregate all email providers, and one to do a mass password rotation. So, past that.

92
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:03.690
Zoom user: We enter the password rotation, we enter a targeted website.

93
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:13.450
Zoom user: And this is where we transition to Ken. So, Ken, this is exactly the part where, when I get to this part, the password rotation.

94
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:20.249
Zoom user: That's where we're gonna pull up your, your screen, which would be the website, whatever. So…

95
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.920
Zoom user: This is where you would talk about it, and this is where, essentially.

96
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:34.260
Zoom user: When we take the real take, I'm gonna break down the password rotation a lot better for you, because as soon as it goes to there, you kind of should have the credentials already loaded up.

97
00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:46.360
Zoom user: and log in, and from that point, you could go and talk about the password generator, and, like, the… finally, the number's loaded, oh my god, thank God. But,

98
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.429
Zoom user: Damn, that's crazy.

99
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:57.419
Zoom user: But, yeah, so… it parses through a user's emails or whatever, with the rejects I developed.

100
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:06.420
Zoom user: And then that's essentially how it's low-key credential stuffing, but that's how we get the verification code, etc.

101
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.849
Zoom user: But you should, you should already have,

102
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:18.979
Zoom user: Because when it switches back to you, Ken, you should already have it filled in, so it's a lot seamless, like, it's pretty seamless. Just so they can kind of see that.

103
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:27.230
Zoom user: Because then, after that, you go to the password generator, and you could talk about the other features, because they're kind of, like, obvious features, like alias.

104
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.430
Kenith Philip: You want me to talk about that, too?

105
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:35.080
Zoom user: The alias is essentially… We kind of had…

106
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.710
Kenith Philip: Basically, like, the fake email, yeah.

107
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:39.200
Zoom user: gig.

108
00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.390
Kenith Philip: I got a couple of aliases, but we don't have it set up.

109
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:50.390
Zoom user: Well, but look at, like, this, like, the overall, the password rotation container, this is the,

110
00:12:51.960 --> 00:13:04.330
Zoom user: that's essentially the alias, right? So the alias is created for the container, and the container's getting destroyed. So, we don't have to talk too much in depth, but that's kind of, like, branching into, like, kind of how that CIC pipeline works with the container.

111
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:12.080
Zoom user: Because, like, this whole thing was generated with the alias email, for them to aggregate all their email services, right?

112
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.910
Kenith Philip: It was not an alias, you know, it was a temporary email.

113
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.290
Zoom user: You're right, temporary email.

114
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:22.319
Kenith Philip: That's because alias is just a…

115
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.390
Kenith Philip: Just a fake label, just something that's real… something that's real.

116
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:30.770
Kenith Philip: But this is, like, temporary. This goes away.

117
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:41.610
Zoom user: Alright, so yeah, scratch that. So then, you talk about the passenger generator? Obviously.

118
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.049
Zoom user: Have the credentials ready, just when we do the transition.

119
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.879
Kenith Philip: Okay, hold on, I'm testing it real quick.

120
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.419
Kenith Philip: Or if you want to skip, we'll figure this out, and, you know.

121
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:09.779
Kenith Philip: talk about that, and then I can… because this is trial anyways.

122
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:25.790
Zoom user: Because this is where we're gonna have to figure out, because this obviously could go back to Aaron, but this could keep going between me and him pretty easily, but this is where we have to find where to put,

123
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.030
Zoom user: Jared to talk?

124
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.710
Zoom user: And then Jules, the talk, because…

125
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.199
Zoom user: Me and go future for future, because we know the whole thing.

126
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.060
Kenith Philip: I'll just have Jared, like, slide through my phone and record it.

127
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:46.660
Kenith Philip: the mobile phone, because it's already, like, here. You're like, oh yeah, you know, as you can see, you know…

128
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:56.169
Kenith Philip: you know, the imports and wood here, and all that stuff, you know what I mean? It's like, oh, it's synced, oh, I can do, I can even do my breach report here, oh, I can do this, it's like, oh, that's a little.

129
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:05.160
Zoom user: Well, see, that's actually a good point, because Jared could be the person that enters his credentials for his breach report, right?

130
00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:08.970
Zoom user: Cause we have to find somewhere for him to fit.

131
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:17.370
Kenith Philip: Yeah, you could just literally just do the mobile, you know, demo, like, slide through, and like…

132
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:18.690
Kenith Philip: All that stuff.

133
00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:24.310
Zoom user: Yeah, he probably has to practice with it, though, because he's never touched… Jared's never touched our software.

134
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:27.320
Kenith Philip: Jerry Camus? You want to check the software?

135
00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.350
Kenith Philip: Sure.

136
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:40.459
Kenith Philip: Essentially, don't even worry about it. Need to sign you in, right?

137
00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:01.189
Zoom user: What are you doing now? I'm just writing a script, because he copied my CDR.

138
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.710
Zoom user: Or married.

139
00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:26.040
Devon Villalona: Okay, no, sure, sure. You haven't been talking about it a little bit.

140
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:32.679
Devon Villalona: Wait, there's an echo. Alright. Holy shit.

141
00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:36.010
Devon Villalona: Cause, what's it called?

142
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:42.979
Devon Villalona: we got, because I, right now, just synced the imports for one of the things for my…

143
00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.140
Devon Villalona: And I'm trying to figure out if I can…

144
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:56.300
Devon Villalona: I want to share it live on Zoom, and killing two birds with one stone, and it's, like, the easiest shit ever, but I don't see an option, because it's tethered right now, I would think it would do that.

145
00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.909
Devon Villalona: It's too ghetto, you think?

146
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.209
Zoom user: No, I don't… I don't think theater at all.

147
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:12.539
Devon Villalona: The other way would be if I join on my phone, and you record it separately, and I show you that way, too. That's another way we can do… yeah, I'll just do that right now.

148
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:20.759
Devon Villalona: Here, let me join. No, I joined on my phone. I can join on Zoom on my phone, yeah. And then I'll have to record and talk at the same time.

149
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.939
Zoom user: Or, what you can't do, Eric…

150
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:28.500
Devon Villalona: I know, I could do that too, but he doesn't know if he can stitch that together. Like, he's the one who's doing the edits.

151
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.130
Zoom user: You know what we should do, Aaron?

152
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.020
Devon Villalona: What's up?

153
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.429
Zoom user: Why don't you just screen record off your phone? Do it?

154
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:49.819
Devon Villalona: Yeah, that's what I was saying, but the thing is, it's like, Jared doesn't know if he can, like, stitch that shit together or something, so, like, it's up to Jared, because I do that and make it separate. It's like, I could do the desktop and just do it separately and do my take, too, and we just go back and forth, and, like, I just, we just give them that.

155
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:58.239
Zoom user: Yeah, I feel like that's easy, like, the low key. Because that was my whole idea to do it on Zoom, it was just… it saves all that extra…

156
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.950
Zoom user: Extra shit we would have to figure out.

157
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.160
Devon Villalona: Oh, but the words, too, right?

158
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:14.179
Devon Villalona: You gotta, like, talk it through, like, the mobile, like, I gotta talk it? Oh, no, you have to do it, actually, fine.

159
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:23.940
Zoom user: Yeah, that's what I was trying to… Because Journey to talk about something new, and it's like, obviously, it's easy to do that with features that are working, like, not buggy.

160
00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.360
Devon Villalona: Okay.

161
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:44.490
Devon Villalona: You could talk about a password reset. I was just talking about the dummy website for, like, for a minute, and then you can just talk about the reset… I mean, the generator.

162
00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.350
Devon Villalona: Now that we've got the generator.

163
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:54.119
Devon Villalona: I'm trying to think… This generator is pretty simple, and there's nothing to mess up and replace it.

164
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:55.659
Devon Villalona: Got it.

165
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.180
Zoom user: Dude, speak!

166
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:07.239
Devon Villalona: Oh, unless I screen record it, and then you record your voice talking it through.

167
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.589
Devon Villalona: Yeah, I could do that too.

168
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:16.459
Devon Villalona: But I can… you know what I'm saying? I give… I send you the screen record of this, and then, like, you basically, like, word it.

169
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:22.000
Devon Villalona: And then, like, what's it called? Use that, I guess.

170
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.920
Devon Villalona: We'll try to get, like, 30 seconds to a minute of it.

171
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.619
Devon Villalona: Yeah, I could do that.

172
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.840
Devon Villalona: So, like, right here, right?

173
00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:37.509
Devon Villalona: I'm a, you know… like, use my words for your voiceover, I guess, right? So, like, you'd be like, oh, this is our mobile implementation of,

174
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:49.510
Devon Villalona: the application, I mean, I'm sorry, of, Go Trigger, you know, this is it. You log in, user's able to use biometric Face ID on the mobile application.

175
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:56.699
Devon Villalona: Not by Matrix, Face ID, holy shit. It's by the same thing? Yeah.

176
00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:58.370
Zoom user: And let me…

177
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:05.030
Devon Villalona: like, get a voice recording, capture audio, because I can always put audio, like, later on.

178
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.350
Devon Villalona: Record.

179
00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.469
Devon Villalona: this. Yeah.

180
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:13.420
Devon Villalona: what you're saying that while also screening that… Yeah.

181
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.260
Zoom user: We'll be good soon, like, 30 minutes?

182
00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:25.750
Devon Villalona: Like, I can put the recording and the voice audio with it. Let me do, like, a… can you do, like, a timer? No, do a timer, I'm gonna do a take and try to see how I sound.

183
00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:30.160
Devon Villalona: Because I want this at least to be, like, at least close to a minute.

184
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:31.570
Devon Villalona: Alright.

185
00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:41.539
Devon Villalona: Here's our password, holy fuck, cut that. I don't cut it, let me just hold off for a second.

186
00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:44.779
Zoom user: Where's this re- where is this being recorded at?

187
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:51.889
Devon Villalona: screen… I'm going… I'm going off a take of a screen record, so, like, I'm practicing the mobile, implementation real quick.

188
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:56.020
Zoom user: No, no, no, it's been screen recording this whole time, that's… I'm just wondering where it's going.

189
00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:01.069
Devon Villalona: Reporting from his phone. Oh, no, he's talking about, he's talking about the Zoom. Oh, the whole meeting. Oh, yeah, the whole meeting, yeah.

190
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.469
Zoom user: This isn't about to be what we're posting. Book.

191
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:11.620
Devon Villalona: I'm gonna post this whole raw footage. Raw no-cuts. This is not bad, you know, this is raw.

192
00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:31.759
Devon Villalona: So here's our, mobile implementation that uses Flutter to connect to our desktop application, Electron. Here, a user can either create an account also here, but also log in via, master user password or Face ID. So let's go ahead and log in.

193
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.799
Devon Villalona: Sign in with Face ID.

194
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:42.479
Devon Villalona: I'm in. And here are all the tiles that are related to our application. They're all in sync, and I shall be showing you,

195
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.389
Devon Villalona: it's API points.

196
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.079
Devon Villalona: So, reach a form.

197
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:54.780
Devon Villalona: In the breach report, we'll go ahead and, check my email.

198
00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.209
Devon Villalona: And see if it works on the mobile, of course, to show you that it is all in sync.

199
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:09.959
Devon Villalona: Mmm… As you can see, The breach details are here.

200
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:15.529
Devon Villalona: All verified by the API have been pwned, and even a new one of this year.

201
00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:38.239
Devon Villalona: And now we'll check the password vault. The password vault, every time we… you go into the password vault, should either be a biometrics scanner, or a face ID, or a master user password. Since I've already, created this account, the face… the biometric ID is already established, so I… I'm able to use my face ID.

202
00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:48.220
Devon Villalona: As you can see, our imports are already synced up from the desktop app that we did before, from lastpassword.csv.

203
00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:55.100
Devon Villalona: And user has the option to also import, their CSV via mobile.

204
00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:58.519
Devon Villalona: And delete all credentials via mobile.

205
00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.880
Devon Villalona: And as you can see, I can delete it, go ahead, delete all.

206
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:03.580
Devon Villalona: Deleted.

207
00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:06.580
Devon Villalona: Okay?

208
00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:14.140
Devon Villalona: And we also have the API for the CV security alerts for the mobile, if user wishes to search specific, CVEs.

209
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.080
Devon Villalona: For, their breach report.

210
00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.410
Devon Villalona: So we put in Walmart.

211
00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:26.830
Devon Villalona: say if, like, Walmart was one of them. Walmart tells you more in detail, like, what happened, or the origin of it.

212
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.479
Devon Villalona: And it gives you a score, severity score.

213
00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.020
Devon Villalona: And… what else were I missing?

214
00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:39.810
Zoom user: We can… oh… Bescent… Excellent.

215
00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:40.660
Devon Villalona: Absolutely.

216
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:41.740
Devon Villalona: Excellent.

217
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.459
Zoom user: Get your Discord.

218
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:48.330
Devon Villalona: I gotta, like, word it better. So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna obviously do the take.

219
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.669
Devon Villalona: How much is it?

220
00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:58.770
Devon Villalona: Two and a half minutes? Two and a half minutes? We can get it down. I'll not get it down, I can clean that up and be more sharp about it.

221
00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:02.590
Devon Villalona: What's it called, what's it called, what's it called?

222
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.230
Devon Villalona: Yes.

223
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.899
Devon Villalona: And of course, I go here, and obviously, like.

224
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:18.580
Devon Villalona: Oh, wow, there's a lot of talk about shit. I even forgot, like, oh, I can even say, like, this right here.

225
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:33.290
Devon Villalona: It's like, as I delete from the app, it's already, like, I forgot, like, it deletes the imports in the app here, too, so, like, you see, like, I can go back here and be like, as you can see, oh, you know, it's in sync, or proof is in sync, blah blah blah, you know? And then, you know…

226
00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.580
Devon Villalona: Get out of here, log out, go back in.

227
00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.990
Devon Villalona: Okay… Awesome.

228
00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.309
Devon Villalona: Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome.

229
00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:56.139
Devon Villalona: Okay, so now we just gotta… I gotta get better words to practice going back and forth.

230
00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.600
Devon Villalona: And… what's it called? What's it called? What's it called?

231
00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.369
Devon Villalona: What was I gonna say?

232
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.399
Devon Villalona: Yeah, back and forth.

233
00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:07.690
Devon Villalona: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

234
00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.629
Devon Villalona: And then… what is it called?

235
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.860
Devon Villalona: Settings, breach report, password vault… Oh, gotta mention cat…

236
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:20.389
Devon Villalona: Where is cachet? Holy fuck, that's pretty fucking important, holy fuck.

237
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:34.309
Zoom user: Yes, yes and no. We need to think about it, it's just only, like, 6 minutes. That's why, that's why I was like, we just gotta focus straight on features, because all that extra jargon we were doing in the CDR, this doesn't matter for that.

238
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.330
Devon Villalona: Yeah.

239
00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:40.950
Devon Villalona: It's been 100 minutes. It turns out there's not a 40-minute. It's definitely been more than an hour.

240
00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:49.849
Devon Villalona: So, we can… when we start it, we gotta… what is the guidelines? Why did you choose a particular project, topic? Oh, we even answer these questions, huh?

241
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:50.480
Devon Villalona: The way…

242
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:59.719
Devon Villalona: The intro, the first question. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, he did, I'm sorry. What'd you think of this project? What problems are we solving? That kind of thing.

243
00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:11.609
Devon Villalona: I like… I like that. This guy has… before we talk about our solution, we need to fully understand the problem we're facing. Data breaches are… this is honestly a really good script, actually. We should probably bring this fucking script.

244
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:28.989
Devon Villalona: Yeah, this is a pretty good, like, look at this. After we do, like, the questions and, like, introduction of the teams, we… it literally is perfect. It's like, before we talk about our solution, we need to fully understand the problem that we're facing. You know, honestly, you should fucking say it, actually. That's a good fucking intro… that's all you have to say. It's…

245
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.649
Zoom user: Why is Jared getting all the freebies, bro? Jared's doing all the talking, bro.

246
00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:40.749
Devon Villalona: But he can literally have, like, a minute and 30 seconds of this introduction. We go straight to features and, like, you know, rapid fire it.

247
00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.720
Zoom user: Jared built the whole project!

248
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:47.779
Devon Villalona: But he's a good speaker, unless you want someone else to do it, or you to do it. I mean, I don't doing it.

249
00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:48.640
Zoom user: Okay.

250
00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.050
Zoom user: He honestly should do it.

251
00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:58.999
Devon Villalona: Yeah, because, like, look, it's a whole fucking… yeah, this is a good script, and he literally just reads it, that's at least a minute or two.

252
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.350
Zoom user: Remember you thought you were leaving at 6PM, Jared?

253
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:12.090
Devon Villalona: Oh, we can also break this shit up, too, like, this is pretty… damn, how long does this shit go, bro?

254
00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:14.400
Zoom user: Whoa…

255
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.400
Devon Villalona: Yo, this is a crazy introduction, low-key.

256
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.850
Zoom user: What are you, what are you looking at?

257
00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:28.820
Devon Villalona: It's the outline, I formatted it, because that shit was fucking hideous to look at when he first gave it to me. I was like, what is this shit?

258
00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.690
Zoom user: Here, you're combining your strip…

259
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.230
Devon Villalona: I could share, I could share, right?

260
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:38.829
Zoom user: Remind your script and my script, because mine talks about one half, he talks about the other half. And we need… we need…

261
00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.710
Zoom user: Check your Discord.

262
00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.099
Devon Villalona: Discord? Where's it at?

263
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.210
Zoom user: I just said to…

264
00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:53.219
Devon Villalona: Isaac, let me ask you again. Do you want me to talk about a dummy vex that I…

265
00:29:53.440 --> 00:30:00.669
Devon Villalona: You already mute this? You wanna mute? I'm not, I'm not talking, I'm using my mic. So,

266
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:05.209
Devon Villalona: What was it, dump me website? Password generator? What else? Is that it?

267
00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.400
Devon Villalona: No, I mean… I'd rather keep the least, but, you know.

268
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:18.470
Zoom user: I mean, maybe you could talk about the PGP key, the privacy, how we're not embedded in systems.

269
00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:28.189
Devon Villalona: Maybe… I feel like it's going a little too deep, like, it's supposed to be, like, server… I mean, surface level.

270
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.740
Zoom user: Meh…

271
00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:34.850
Zoom user: Because then, honestly, if we do that, it just goes back to Aaron, then, and we just finish the features, that's it.

272
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:37.560
Devon Villalona: Yeah, I feel like we'll… we bellow over time by then.

273
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.620
Devon Villalona: Half a generator, observation, and… Along with that.

274
00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:46.899
Zoom user: Yeah, we look at, like, 30 minutes, because Jared probably has, like, an hour to submit this.

275
00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:48.870
Devon Villalona: Yeah, I…

276
00:30:49.140 --> 00:31:00.550
Devon Villalona: Like, the window's getting smaller. Yeah, 100%. No, it's gonna be, like, an hour, bro. You're probably gonna be, like, 15 minutes of an interview.

277
00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:15.690
Devon Villalona: Don't we just have to do an embedded link? What? The YouTube link? Couldn't we, like… it's just a link, yeah. But you gotta edit it, upload it to YouTube? But the link still is the same, right? Or no, does it change?

278
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:24.559
Devon Villalona: You get what I'm saying? Oh, like, change the video after? No, like, so, like, so, like, if we were to establish, like, a rough draft, or not, you know what I mean, we do some YouTube, and then…

279
00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.540
Devon Villalona: like…

280
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:36.660
Devon Villalona: re-upload it, does the link change? No, the link stays the same, right? Or does? It does change, fuck. When you upload another video, it'll be a new video? You can't replace it. Yeah, you're right.

281
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:43.439
Devon Villalona: Deployment pipeline… I believe in…

282
00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.070
Devon Villalona: Okay.

283
00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.579
Devon Villalona: Oh, I see the script now from what you're doing.

284
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:10.699
Zoom user: Yeah, because that script means you can combine with yours, because mine's talking about the ether mail. I need the.

285
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.279
Devon Villalona: The one I'm using is,

286
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.670
Devon Villalona: Jared's one, the one I have for the CDR.

287
00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:19.089
Zoom user: Yeah, his little…

288
00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:19.919
Devon Villalona: Can I use that?

289
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:25.089
Zoom user: His is… his is a little, it's… it's a little outdated.

290
00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.190
Devon Villalona: Alright, I'm gonna have to make one then, real quick.

291
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:36.559
Zoom user: Because you can just combine ours to the .text, because mine is pretty well-written, it just needs yours to be as well-written, it can just be one script, and we could just break it up.

292
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:40.209
Devon Villalona: I'll do it right now. Let me… let me make one for the desktop.

293
00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.030
Devon Villalona: I don't even know, like, that's what's weird, it's like, I don't even think it closes, does it?

294
00:32:50.510 --> 00:33:02.560
Devon Villalona: Like, I'm so con… let me look at… let me just do this first, before I say it. Gerber said something bad to me, I mean, what was he doing that? Well, if you don't do it, it's like… he said if you don't do it, you're cooked, buddy. Yeah, he said something like that, but, you know, he always says that, it's usually fun.

295
00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:04.949
Devon Villalona: Hi, today.

296
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.620
Devon Villalona: I'm not saying weather.

297
00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:20.690
Devon Villalona: I think it should be fine. New window, let me do this, new terminal window, terminal… Different deadline, it's not a timing, right? That's the thing. They're not reading it, they're complaining so quick, or anything?

298
00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.350
Devon Villalona: Yeah.

299
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.300
Zoom user: Yeah, but they'll definitely snitch.

300
00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:26.660
Devon Villalona: What?

301
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:29.209
Zoom user: They'll say that we turned it in late.

302
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:32.870
Devon Villalona: We can't.

303
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.880
Zoom user: No, I'm saying, I feel like if we turn in late, they'd probably say something.

304
00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:49.150
Zoom user: Dude, like, that go trigger… They thought they were clever.

305
00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:59.810
Zoom user: Damn, Curry goes independent? And he said fuck Under Armour. Respect?

306
00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:15.010
Zoom user: Yeah, cause this next take we do it, it's gonna be the take we submit, because I'm looking ready.

307
00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:25.589
Devon Villalona: Alright, well, they're working on it, let me see… so, all the… all I'm gonna say is this list, or tell me… this is a test website we created.

308
00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:31.059
Devon Villalona: to test path of rotation,

309
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:36.819
Devon Villalona: password rotation's working. I'm going to sign in to see what happens when you get in.

310
00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.360
Zoom user: Mmm…

311
00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:51.370
Devon Villalona: And as you can see, login was successful. This gives us a simple UI that tells us what the username is, what the email is, and how long.

312
00:34:51.959 --> 00:34:52.549
Zoom user: burned.

313
00:34:53.409 --> 00:35:01.780
Devon Villalona: And then, go back here, another feature we have is a password generator that lets users create a password that

314
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:04.440
Devon Villalona: left and securely.

315
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.919
Devon Villalona: Care the account, I mean…

316
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:19.219
Devon Villalona: And you have choices between using a random sequence of characters, using memorable words, or just numbers. We also have a dial here, your size.

317
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:24.730
Devon Villalona: Over to… Something happening, I think. It's you, right? I mean, always, always…

318
00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:31.360
Devon Villalona: What? No, I'm just, like, run through, I'm running through what I would say.

319
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.330
Devon Villalona: Second minute.

320
00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:35.410
Devon Villalona: Weird.

321
00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:36.670
Devon Villalona: I didn't count here.

322
00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:38.240
Devon Villalona: It was weird, bro.

323
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.539
Zoom user: I'm a little baby.

324
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.020
Zoom user: Fuck.

325
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:05.020
Zoom user: Listen meant D-Rag.

326
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.609
Zoom user: Until we go live.

327
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:30.400
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: What?

328
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.130
Zoom user: Had it on video slot.

329
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:43.949
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: You guys wanna run a… a real take?

330
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:44.710
Zoom user: Yeah, and it's gonna be…

331
00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:50.620
Zoom user: Where'd you… where'd you one take? He's doing the last thing, because this is gonna be the real take, and we're just gonna submit it.

332
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.370
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Yeah, because even if it's, like.

333
00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.880
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Mid. At least we submit so many.

334
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:05.339
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: And we'll show what we… what we're… we'll guide them, like you said, to what works. We're not gonna show them the buggy stuff.

335
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:13.680
Zoom user: Yeah, we were just making sure Jared had something to talk about.

336
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:24.440
Zoom user: And, ken, too, because… We're not talking about all the extra crap.

337
00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:35.459
Devon Villalona: I was gonna say, wouldn't it be easy for Jar to just do the intro for a script, or…

338
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:43.420
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Yeah. I don't really… I don't really care to talk, so if you could… Jared, you could have all my.

339
00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:51.499
Devon Villalona: No, I don't think, like… it doesn't say, like, we all, like, do an introduction, but it doesn't say, like… like, all of us have to… Yeah.

340
00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:55.720
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Yeah, it doesn't, so… But I mean, like, it's like…

341
00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.610
Devon Villalona: Yeah, yeah, of course, of course.

342
00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:00.370
Devon Villalona: I don't know, just…

343
00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:02.090
Zoom user: So we're giving all to Jared.

344
00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.720
Devon Villalona: Chad would love that.

345
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.360
Devon Villalona: Yeah, so it would just be easier if I talked through the whole thing.

346
00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:13.970
Zoom user: Yeah. They were like, of course the Asian talked the whole time.

347
00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:20.689
Devon Villalona: Well, yeah, I could just do the intro for whatever script that I wrote up, if that works.

348
00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:29.249
Zoom user: Well, no, no, no, no, give him the new script. His old script is from our CER. That's not talking about the features.

349
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:31.569
Devon Villalona: Yeah, that… well, that's the shit Aaron gave me to…

350
00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:33.819
Zoom user: Yeah, no, no, no, it's fine, it's fine.

351
00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:39.970
Devon Villalona: I just gave him… I gave him an updated script so he could bind it with my… with mine, so… I'm gonna do it now.

352
00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.460
Devon Villalona: Oh, you gonna forward it? Yeah, hold on.

353
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:44.340
Devon Villalona: Yeah.

354
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:52.099
Devon Villalona: This shit's buggy, I don't know why it looks like that, but it's doing it.

355
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.739
Devon Villalona: Here's the presentation script… Here it is.

356
00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:04.350
Devon Villalona: Is the Enterprise Pass for Cross Pass Platform Manager inspired by… Don't even worry about it, I'm gonna take that out. Apples.

357
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:08.519
Devon Villalona: Oh, it says inspired by it, I didn't even mean to say that, it's crazy. Should it?

358
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.099
Devon Villalona: Should I even put that? Inspired by Apple's keychain architecture, right? Take that shit out.

359
00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:13.990
Zoom user: No.

360
00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.469
Devon Villalona: Wing this office.

361
00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.579
Devon Villalona: Brother, this is my project, bro.

362
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:22.800
Devon Villalona: I just did it. There's an enterprise-grade cross-platform password-managed word.

363
00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.580
Devon Villalona: Take out this one.

364
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:31.880
Devon Villalona: That's right. Inspired by an security model. No, I'm gonna say, this.

365
00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:48.570
Devon Villalona: Holy fucking Christ, this shit sucks, man. Trying to be fucking manager IMC. Is enterprise-grade classified for manager, with a security model, to say that. Oh, and security modeling as well, you know.

366
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:53.509
Devon Villalona: And… what the fuck is going on? Oh, it's still doing it?

367
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.469
Devon Villalona: Jesus Christ, whatever, bro.

368
00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:00.720
Devon Villalona: That's a fat-ass script, bro. Is it done?

369
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:03.199
Devon Villalona: Finally is done. Huge.

370
00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.360
Zoom user: Send it to me, because I feel like it did a lot of extra crap.

371
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.749
Devon Villalona: It probably did. It's only… well, no, this is for the desktop.

372
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:15.789
Zoom user: I'm, like, doing a… not a script, an update, because I haven't done the update for, like.

373
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:20.120
Devon Villalona: The new thing for the mobile and, what's it called?

374
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:25.079
Devon Villalona: And the, the desktop. So it's, like, putting, like.

375
00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:27.789
Devon Villalona: The right features, because it's saying, like, yeah, this is a…

376
00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:40.479
Devon Villalona: password manager, security model, and it features end-to-end encryption, multi-device sync, yup, and support for importing 45 Plus Password Manager. You see, that's, like… Are we still talking about Apple's keychain sync here?

377
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.969
Devon Villalona: No, we're not talking.

378
00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:44.740
Zoom user: Because we're doing the encryption, but we're not…

379
00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:48.670
Devon Villalona: Yeah, yeah, everything… I already took that Apple keychain shit out, don't even worry about it.

380
00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:56.920
Devon Villalona: Alright, cool, I'm gonna just send this to you then. This looks pretty good, and then let me see… yup, browsing, yup, wow, it's actually pretty good.

381
00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.809
Devon Villalona: Yeah, this is gonna be good with your script, actually. This is legit what everything's done.

382
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.749
Devon Villalona: Alright, let me get it for you. I'mma send it back.

383
00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:15.369
Devon Villalona: It probably did do a lot, bud.

384
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:19.500
Devon Villalona: I'll give you, where's that? Password sync?

385
00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:21.980
Devon Villalona: Here it is.

386
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:38.929
Devon Villalona: Oh, no, that's the old one, let me do this one. Let me save, I didn't save that.

387
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.980
Zoom user: I just hope it's still record…

388
00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:51.110
Zoom user: The thing about this video recording is… let me stop it real quick.

389
00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:01.860
Devon Villalona: Alright, I'm gonna send it to you.

390
00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.719
Devon Villalona: I don't even need to fucking charge this shit again. Fucked.

391
00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:20.159
Devon Villalona: Alright, send you the updated, of what the desktop app is doing currently, and the mobile. The talking points, you combine it together.

392
00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.349
Devon Villalona: Which we're going.

393
00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:28.700
Devon Villalona: About an hour and a half.

394
00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:37.459
Devon Villalona: Only 7 minutes, what the fuck am I tripping for? I'm acting like it's a CDR, bro, what do I… I just get to the point, you know? Fuck.

395
00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.180
Devon Villalona: Bro, I'm gonna need a fucking charger, bro.

396
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:50.759
Devon Villalona: Where are you at right now? 60? There's 60? Oh, dude, I'm at 10. Yeah, yeah, let me work. Yeah, I'm gonna need that, bro. I've been working on the code, buddy!

397
00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:59.240
Devon Villalona: Dude, it's fucking Zoom. Mine would have lasted all day. I didn't charge last night, that's why. I was working on my bed on the website and researching.

398
00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:22.729
Devon Villalona: What the fuck is it? What? Are you using it? What, your charger?

399
00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.210
Devon Villalona: Nice.

400
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:27.900
Devon Villalona: You got it.

401
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:30.700
Devon Villalona: You couldn't hear a baby in front of me.

402
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:36.069
Devon Villalona: And what we tried to do last night.

403
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:46.059
Devon Villalona: You gave it to me, and I remember you unplugging it, but putting it back in your backpack. Probably took it home, wasn't there.

404
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:53.170
Devon Villalona: I mean, I technically could just use USB-C, right? Yeah. It should be slower.

405
00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:01.640
Devon Villalona: Oh, I'm fucking stupid behind the couch. I'm like, there's no way, because I remember taking a nap.

406
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:12.150
Devon Villalona: I remember I came here, and Tony John, like, we're doing this, we're like, You know, during the…

407
00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:18.159
Devon Villalona: Can I go ahead.

408
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:24.809
Devon Villalona: Fuck it is, dude. Alright, let's move over.

409
00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.010
Devon Villalona: Phone.

410
00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:34.460
Devon Villalona: Alright.

411
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.460
Devon Villalona: Awesome. Power's here.

412
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:48.030
Zoom user: Okay, so I could do the introduction.

413
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:54.180
Zoom user: I'll introduce myself, introduce the group, or introduce the platform, etc.

414
00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:04.700
Zoom user: after we all do the introductions, we talk about ourselves, whatever, we're gonna go straight to, the preach report, and Jerry could do the preach report.

415
00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:13.140
Zoom user: entries, credentials, And then, from there, it could go back to Aaron with,

416
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:16.760
Zoom user: What is it? What was it,

417
00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:21.020
Zoom user: What'd you do after the breach report last time, Aaron?

418
00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:22.919
Devon Villalona: As I did the breach report.

419
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:27.509
Devon Villalona: What's it called? After I did the breach report, we went to the mail sink.

420
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:33.880
Zoom user: Okay, so, okay, so, yeah So we'll… so we'll go back to the M-Sync. I'll talk about,

421
00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.950
Zoom user: The external account again, and pass rotation, and then…

422
00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:46.690
Zoom user: that's where Ken will come in, talk about the password generator, and his website, etc, how we're tech…

423
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:53.089
Zoom user: how we allegedly tested against it or whatever, because we're not going to show that during the demo. And then,

424
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:57.579
Zoom user: After that, it'll go back to, Aaron.

425
00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:00.760
Zoom user: And then you could test them,

426
00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:05.800
Zoom user: your phone, whatever, by the time we test on your phone, that's, like, 5 minutes, I believe.

427
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:13.489
Zoom user: And, then we could talk about the other additional features if we need extra time, we just gotta keep eyes on the clock,

428
00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:20.609
Zoom user: About, like, the severity scoring algorithm, and then converting the,

429
00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:27.670
Zoom user: the password file, etc, to the vault.

430
00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:45.919
Zoom user: Or whatever, because the whole thing from where we bridge is when we… I do all the resets, whatever, etc, it gets sent to Aaron, allegedly, and Aaron will put that in the vault, and it gets converted in the vault. So, they're two systems, but yet there's a point that they, talk to each other.

431
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:52.249
Zoom user: So, that'd be, like, the end feature, I guess, to conversion. So, that's something we kind of have to…

432
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:58.690
Devon Villalona: We're not demoing it, right? We're just gonna state that it works.

433
00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:08.309
Zoom user: Yes. Yes. Well, for the rotation, yes, because I broke it last second, and I'm too tired to fix it right now.

434
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:12.980
Zoom user: So, yeah, so…

435
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:24.639
Zoom user: I go over the rotation, etc, external. Once you get the patch generator, whatever, you go to your website, whatever, say we tested against it, or whatever, and this is, like, live polling or whatever.

436
00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:31.389
Devon Villalona: No, you're gonna be talking about that. I'm gonna save the, generator thing, then I'm gonna hand it off to you.

437
00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.890
Zoom user: You're not handing me nothing off. You're doing it all.

438
00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:37.070
Devon Villalona: Bruh, no, man, I can do it.

439
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:39.889
Devon Villalona: I don't have a dollar for it, bro.

440
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.339
Zoom user: Oh, it's his confidence, my guy.

441
00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.340
Devon Villalona: Chicago?

442
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:52.440
Zoom user: Alright, but yeah. Oh, that's, that's who I low-key forgot about, Jules…

443
00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:57.280
Zoom user: Loki, Jules could just talk about the legal aspect of my app.

444
00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:00.719
Zoom user: Like, right here?

445
00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.850
Devon Villalona: That's a definite, it's all legal.

446
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:09.850
Zoom user: That's literally what you could talk about.

447
00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:11.759
Zoom user: The word of Joseph.

448
00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:13.300
Devon Villalona: Rules?

449
00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:17.030
Devon Villalona: Maybe for y'all, everybody else. Yeah, I'm Oh, my God.

450
00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:18.659
Zoom user: Jules, if so…

451
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:29.870
Zoom user: If you could go to this website real quick, the only part you're gonna talk about, it's gonna be about the contact and terms, and… just, like, the legality aspect of the whole thing.

452
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.480
Devon Villalona: The breach report.

453
00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:40.279
Devon Villalona: Or, I mean, how am I doing that?

454
00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:47.849
Devon Villalona: You'll be putting in your email as a thing. Wait, oh yeah, it's not running on your computer, it's running on his computer. Yeah, it's running on my computer.

455
00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.890
Devon Villalona: So, I guess, by Devon's screen.

456
00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:52.350
Devon Villalona: Organically.

457
00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:54.599
Devon Villalona: Yeah, that's the only thing that makes sense.

458
00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:55.990
Devon Villalona: Right?

459
00:48:56.470 --> 00:49:03.320
Devon Villalona: Isaac, you're hearing this, right? For him to do it, for Jared to do it, the breach report?

460
00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:09.289
Devon Villalona: You can also use Aaron's computer, because that's the only one with the app running.

461
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:13.700
Zoom user: I mean, they could just switch seats really quick.

462
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.120
Devon Villalona: Gotta say, yeah, it's fine.

463
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:17.780
Zoom user: Cause, like, at that point, it just…

464
00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:21.710
Zoom user: Yeah, I mean, I think that works, honestly.

465
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:24.560
Devon Villalona: So yeah, you're coming over, Jared.

466
00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:28.269
Zoom user: Unless, what other, what other part can he fit in?

467
00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:32.589
Devon Villalona: I was gonna say either do an intro, like, I guess the intro, like.

468
00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:33.930
Zoom user: I'm gonna do the intro.

469
00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:35.289
Devon Villalona: You gonna do that? Okay, bad.

470
00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.360
Devon Villalona: Let me think.

471
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.159
Zoom user: Jules is doing…

472
00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.670
Devon Villalona: Legit is the perfect one, honestly.

473
00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:42.000
Zoom user: Yeah, go ahead.

474
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:42.900
Devon Villalona: Like, he literally…

475
00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:44.440
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: I'm on the contacts and stuff.

476
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:49.310
Zoom user: Yeah, you could just do that part, the little legal aspect. But.

477
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.609
Devon Villalona: If he does the mobile, all he'd have to do is what? Just, record his voice over the video? Could you do that?

478
00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.470
Zoom user: Oh, very good.

479
00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:03.220
Devon Villalona: And he could just type it in, you know? I can make a video for you, or whatever. Hour 15.

480
00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:08.780
Devon Villalona: See, oh, the final committees for Gerber filing came out, let's go… the forms.

481
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:11.680
Devon Villalona: Let me see, let me see.

482
00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:21.899
Devon Villalona: This is for our section, here it is, GGGG. Yep, go trigger right there now. This is our class. Let's click on it, see what it looks like. It's just the, you know, the thing we did for the CDR.

483
00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:33.450
Devon Villalona: For sure. Evaluator, problem understanding the group, problem-solving approach, design, implementation, functional performance of the prototype. So this is filled out by our committee? Committee, yeah.

484
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:36.200
Devon Villalona: Rate 1 and 10. Nice, okay.

485
00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:37.780
Devon Villalona: I'm killing.

486
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:39.610
Devon Villalona: Nope.

487
00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:42.460
Devon Villalona: This one has been here.

488
00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:58.669
Devon Villalona: All right, gentlemen. Yes, we should, we should… Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was gonna say, yeah. Okay, so, yeah, I think I could, I could do the mobile, like, screen record, talk it over, and he can just, like, stitch his voice over, right? You could do that, Jared, for the mobile?

489
00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:15.180
Devon Villalona: For that… for that, because, like, that's… the mobile's gonna be the last thing, and then I will do a voiceover and be like, oh, you can see here this in sync, oh, I'm gonna search up this, and he could just do his own voiceover and just, like, put it for the mobile, and that would be the last thing. Not the last thing to do, but that could be a section. I can do that right after we record and do this part.

490
00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.200
Devon Villalona: You know?

491
00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:18.140
Zoom user: Okay, let me just make sure.

492
00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:30.620
Devon Villalona: He's probably gonna have to do it here, because if he lives, like, 20 minutes away, doesn't that, like, add more time? Because what else is he gonna do it? What do you mean? Like, he was gonna do it on his computer at home. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

493
00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:34.890
Devon Villalona: Think it's gonna all work out in time? I think so. 10.45.

494
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:38.979
Devon Villalona: 1 hour and 15 minutes for everything.

495
00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.750
Devon Villalona: We should probably skip out on editing.

496
00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:55.020
Devon Villalona: No, we can make it. I think so, I hope so.

497
00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:58.969
Zoom user: I just don't know, I just wanna make sure this is recording.

498
00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.319
Devon Villalona: Was that what you're checking right now? Did it work?

499
00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.090
Zoom user: Yeah…

500
00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:12.900
Devon Villalona: Did you think you do it?

501
00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:16.609
Devon Villalona: Like, dude, I'm gonna do my best.

502
00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:24.030
Zoom user: And it says unable to send the request because the host is recording a cloud recording. Okay, well, allegedly it's still recording. Okay.

503
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:30.140
Devon Villalona: Yeah, I can see somebody recording. Yeah, that's good.

504
00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:37.150
Devon Villalona: Everybody's… everybody gets access, though. I've accepted everybody's request. I'm a very benevolent person. Everybody gets access to everything.

505
00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:39.070
Zoom user: Damn!

506
00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:47.790
Zoom user: Hey, dude, everything's been sitting now, we gotta, we gotta start, we gotta start. We're doing this in one shot, one shot and one shot only.

507
00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:53.149
Devon Villalona: No coach? No, nothing. If anybody stutters, we just move on.

508
00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.570
Zoom user: No, no one's stuttering, bro, you ain't gotta stutter.

509
00:52:56.570 --> 00:53:03.300
Devon Villalona: For my tile for the CVE, risk tile, do you want me to do that after you come back to me at the password vault?

510
00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.600
Zoom user: So, after… I'll do a quick.

511
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:11.560
Devon Villalona: breach report, and then back to you, and then you come back to me, and I do the Pass Revolt imports.

512
00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:17.210
Devon Villalona: And then… I'm saying, like, the CV security risk, do you want that impaired with the breach report?

513
00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:39.149
Zoom user: No, no, no, save them for the end, because once you do the, breach report, it comes to me, I do external and rotation, he talks about, generator, and then Jules would talk about the localities or whatever, and then that could transition to you guys, and you guys could just finish it off, with the CV scoring algorithm and the, mobile, and that's it. I think we'll have enough time.

514
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:40.230
Devon Villalona: Awesome.

515
00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:50.509
Devon Villalona: It would be easier for you to do the mobile, like, add the mobile here, so that he doesn't have to do the whole thing? What do you mean, add the mobile here? Like…

516
00:53:51.040 --> 00:54:02.399
Devon Villalona: join with the phone, do the Zoom meeting, and then just screen share? Yeah, I could do that, fuck it, I can do that, yeah. But, like, the thing is, it's like, he has to, like, put his voice over it. Yeah.

517
00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.140
Devon Villalona: Okay.

518
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:08.640
Devon Villalona: Honestly.

519
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:13.619
Zoom user: Maybe that could work. Aaron could just literally show the phone, and Jared's just doing the fucking narration.

520
00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:17.859
Devon Villalona: Yeah, and when you do the detection, use my email.

521
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.320
Devon Villalona: Yeah.

522
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:32.529
Devon Villalona: Yeah. Give them a female? Just, can you give them it to me, like, I don't know, just fucking… I'm gonna remember that. The text or some shit?

523
00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:37.520
Devon Villalona: No, like, what is it called? Zeiss what? It's my last name and my first name.

524
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:40.289
Zoom user: Bear with me.

525
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:42.860
Devon Villalona: Zayas?

526
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:52.469
Devon Villalona: It's on Zoom? How about you screen share, so you can't move out of Zoom.

527
00:54:55.580 --> 00:55:01.340
Devon Villalona: Gotta app now. Oh, we can do it on the phone? I'll… I'll… I'll contribute on my phone.

528
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:04.460
Devon Villalona: Oh, yeah, just write it down so he remembers or something.

529
00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.459
Devon Villalona: Or just sending me a Discord.

530
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:09.280
Zoom user: ephemeral.

531
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:17.039
Devon Villalona: Either way, we're gonna have to do a cut to the mobile anyways, because it's… I gotta pull it up and shit, like, it's a cut.

532
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:20.540
Zoom user: Honestly, you could just… bro, you could just…

533
00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.880
Zoom user: Damn, this camera sucks with that.

534
00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:36.190
Zoom user: Ephemeral We practice.

535
00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:38.410
Devon Villalona: You son, thank you.

536
00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.230
Zoom user: What's up, girl?

537
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:43.200
Devon Villalona: You're… Wow.

538
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:47.990
Devon Villalona: Awesome,

539
00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:53.110
Devon Villalona: What else do we gotta do? I think I'm ready to go and get this show on the road and do this take.

540
00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:55.670
Zoom user: Yeah, let's… let's… let's bang this hoe out.

541
00:55:56.220 --> 00:56:01.830
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: You want me to read… I… I don't think I need to read this whole Terms of Service thing right here.

542
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:06.249
Zoom user: No, no, no, just do, like, the legalities, like, just a general over… like, an overview.

543
00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:09.469
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Okay, just like the… just like the other thing.

544
00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.470
Zoom user: Yeah.

545
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:14.050
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Cause I'm just… I'm just gonna do it from the dome, then. Just like the other…

546
00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:19.030
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Alright, let me know.

547
00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:20.719
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: I'm ready when you guys are.

548
00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.680
Zoom user: Yeah, no, I'm really impressed.

549
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:32.239
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Do you want to restart this reporting, then?

550
00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:36.230
Zoom user: No, this recording isn't going the whole entire time, he could just snip it, honestly.

551
00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:37.420
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Okay.

552
00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:42.809
Jared Zayas: But I mean, like, if you're gonna send it to me, it would probably just be easier to be a smaller file, because if you send me.

553
00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:43.940
Zoom user: Oh, you don't want 10 gigabits?

554
00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:45.360
Jared Zayas: 2 hours long.

555
00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.520
Zoom user: You want 10 gigs?

556
00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:51.130
Jared Zayas: It's gonna, like… my computer might shit itself.

557
00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:56.400
Zoom user: Yeah, I don't know, stop that, if someone wants to… if he wants to share.

558
00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:59.440
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: We gonna edit it tonight and send it all tonight.

559
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:03.629
Jared Zayas: Dog, I don't even… I don't know if I'm gonna get it on time, but…

560
00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:05.560
Jared Zayas: Oh my gosh, you're hurting, man.

561
00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.220
Zoom user: One thing about Jared, bro, Jared is clutch.

562
00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:10.850
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: It's already 11, bro.

563
00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:12.849
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

564
00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:14.409
Zoom user: Jordan breathes… he breathes close.

565
00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:16.119
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Y'all gotta let Dan go, bro.

566
00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.150
Jared Zayas: This baby.

567
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:18.580
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Go cut this thing up.

568
00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:21.359
Jared Zayas: Jared plus Elias.

569
00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.499
Zoom user: Bro, bro was born to be clutch.

570
00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:27.659
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: Boom. Let's roll.

571
00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:28.710
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: You guys are.

572
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:29.330
Zoom user: Are we…

573
00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:29.649
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: No, dude.

574
00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:35.279
Zoom user: Let's see if you can charge me a new recording, though, because he is right, that is, like, fucking 10 gigabytes.

575
00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:35.820
Jared Zayas: True.

576
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:36.460
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: if…

577
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:39.710
Zoom user: It's done a fucking man.

578
00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:40.570
Devon Villalona: Stop right.

579
00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:41.340
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: thing.

580
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:43.680
Zoom user: Yeah, Ken, can you stop the recording?

581
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:47.329
Jhuiwensley Belizaire: It's a good thing.
