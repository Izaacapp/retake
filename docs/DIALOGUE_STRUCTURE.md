## Engagement Style

- Technical deep-dives (IMAP/POP, Dovecot, Postfix)
- Platform architecture & features
- Problem/solution framing

### Ken's Role
- **Feature specialist** (handles testing & password generation)
- Explains user-facing features
- Demonstrates testing methodology
- Provides user perspective

### Collaboration Style
- **Professional handoffs**: Clear transitions with acknowledgments
- **Complementary expertise**: Izaac = architecture, Ken = UX features
- **Seamless flow**: Each speaker builds on the previous segment
- **Natural engagement**: References to each other create cohesion

## Why This Matters for TTS

When generating TTS audio:
1. **Izaac's voice** should convey technical authority
2. **Ken's voice** should convey user-friendly explanations
3. **Transitions** must feel natural, not jarring
4. **Acknowledgments** ("Thanks Ken") create dialogue, not monologue
5. **Tone shifts** between speakers add variety and engagement

## Production Notes

- Izaac segments: ~45 segments
- Ken segments: ~6 segments
